Rapid and automated analysis of plant pathogen genome sequences is needed for more effective responses to disease outbreaks, but its complexity necessitates advanced bioinformatic techniques.
We developed the pathogensurveillance pipeline for the automated identification of individuals or groups of pathogens and exploration of their genomic diversity without the need for bioinformatics experience.
Pathogensurveillance takes as input raw reads from potentially unidentified eukaryotic or prokaryotic organisms.
The pipeline automatically determines a taxonomic placement, finds the closest reference genome sequences, maps sequence reads, calls variants, identifies core genes, and reports phylogenetic relationships and identifications.
References are selected and downloaded automatically from the NCBI RefSeq database or can be supplied by the user.
For each user-defined group of samples, an HTML report with statistics and interactive figures/tables is made.
A static PDF version is also made.
Advanced users can access the intermediate files to conduct further analyses.
It can be executed on any Linux computer, from laptops to large-scale cloud computing environments.
It is written in Nextflow, allowing it to take advantage of massive computational resources when available, restart failed analyses, or add samples to existing analyses without doing redundant work.
Our pipeline automates and accelerates analysis of whole genome sequence data, which is essential for rapid responses to disease outbreaks, while allowing genomic analysis by non-bioinformaticians.
